# Fake News Detection System

## Overview
The **Fake News Detection System** is a Python-based application leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques to classify news articles as `Real` or `Fake`. This project aims to address the widespread issue of misinformation in the digital age.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization to clean and prepare the text.
- **Feature Engineering**: Vectorizing text using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF).
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Includes Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting models.
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Technology Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Scikit-learn
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
  - NLTK
  - XGBoost
- **Development Environment**: Jupyter Notebook

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries (see `requirements.txt`)

### Dataset
The dataset consists of labeled news articles categorized as `Real` or `Fake`. Ensure the dataset is placed in the project directory before running the application.

### How to Run
1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd fake-news-detection
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter notebook to explore the project:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Fake_News_Detection.ipynb
   ```

### Code Structure
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and tokenize the text data.
- **Feature Engineering**: Generate TF-IDF features.
- **Model Training**: Train and evaluate various machine learning models.
- **Results Visualization**: Plot confusion matrices and performance metrics.

## Results
The model achieved the following performance metrics:
- **Accuracy**: _e.g., 95%_
- **Precision**: _e.g., 93%_
- **Recall**: _e.g., 94%_
- **F1-Score**: _e.g., 93.5%_

The detailed evaluation is available in the notebook, including confusion matrices and ROC curves.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement deep learning techniques such as LSTMs or transformers for improved accuracy.
- Integrate additional datasets for robust performance.
- Develop a user-friendly web interface for real-time predictions.
